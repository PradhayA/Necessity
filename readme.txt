My project is called Necessity. This project involves solving the issue of homelessness üè°. The idea behind this project was that people may not have time or are too busy to actually donate used clothes or food to the homeless for charity. Additionally, the homeless have very little support themselves so for their welfare, normal people like you and I need to look out for them and report them to a dedicated charity such as Shelter. Volunteer may also be busy and not have enough time to help for the cause. They have raised many projects to help eradicate homelessness. I have created a prototype website to help raise awareness and promote the fact that we need to solve this stark crisis. 

I have also created a ChatBot which can  help people to interact with ease and donate clothes. The organisation's computer will allocate a volunteer to a donator. Volunteers can choose when they would like to help out. Lots of other features are available with the prototype ChatBot. The ChatBot is also located on Facebook where there a lot of enthusiastic volunteers and donators may be located to help for the cause.

If you would like to visit the website individually, access this link below or paste in your browser. From here hit the orange button on the right hand side to access the ChatBot:
